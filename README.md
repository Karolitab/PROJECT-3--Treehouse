# PROJECT-3
 My third project of my tech-degree javascript course. Data validation
This code crates a form that validates the user input according to regex and some specifications.
EXTRA CREDIT{
Created a real time error message in the name field and email field with the keyup addevent listener
Created an different error message for the email field. If the email is formatted incorrectly, the error would say:
"Email address must be formatted correctly"
if the email field is blank the rror would say:"Email cannot be empty"
/**PREVENTS THE USER SELECTING ACTIVITIES THAT HAVE THE SAME DAY AND TIME */
/**Creates a function that if a clicked activity box has the same date and time that another, will disable the latter*/
